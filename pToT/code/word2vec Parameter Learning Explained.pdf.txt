word2vec Parameter Learning Explained

Xin Rong

ronxin@umich.edu

Abstract

The word2vec model and application by Mikolov et al. have attracted a great
amount of attention in recent two years. The vector representations of words learned
by word2vec models have been shown to carry semantic meanings and are useful in
various NLP tasks. As an increasing number of researchers would like to experiment
with word2vec or similar techniques, I notice that there lacks a material that compre-
hensively explains the parameter learning process of word embedding models in details,
thus preventing researchers that are non-experts in neural networks from understanding
the working mechanism of such models.

This note provides detailed derivations and explanations of the parameter up-
date equations of the word2vec models, including the original continuous bag-of-word
(CBOW) and skip-gram (SG) models, as well as advanced optimization techniques,
including hierarchical softmax and negative sampling. Intuitive interpretations of the
gradient equations are also provided alongside mathematical derivations.

In the appendix, a review on the basics of neuron networks and backpropagation
is provided. I also created an interactive demo, wevi, to facilitate the intuitive under-
standing of the model.1

1 Continuous Bag-of-Word Model

1.1 One-word context

We start from the simplest version of the continuous bag-of-word model (CBOW) intro-
duced in Mikolov et al. (2013a). We assume that there is only one word considered per
context, which means the model will predict one target word given one context word, which
is like a bigram model. For readers who are new to neural networks, it is recommended that
one go through Appendix A for a quick review of the important concepts and terminologies
before proceeding further.

Figure 1 shows the network model under the simpliﬁed context deﬁnition2.

In our
setting, the vocabulary size is V , and the hidden layer size is N . The units on adjacent

2In Figures 1, 2, 3, and the rest of this note, W(cid:48) is not the transpose of W, but a diﬀerent matrix

instead.

layers are fully connected. The input is a one-hot encoded vector, which means for a given
input context word, only one out of V units, {x1,··· , xV }, will be 1, and all other units
are 0.
The weights between the input layer and the output layer can be represented by a
V × N matrix W. Each row of W is the N -dimension vector representation vw of the
associated word of the input layer. Formally, row i of W is vT
w. Given a context (a word),
assuming xk = 1 and xk(cid:48) = 0 for k(cid:48) (cid:54)= k, we have

h = WT x = WT

(k,·) := vT
wI

,

(1)

which is essentially copying the k-th row of W to h. vwI is the vector representation of the
input word wI . This implies that the link (activation) function of the hidden layer units is
simply linear (i.e., directly passing its weighted sum of inputs to the next layer).

which is an N × V matrix. Using these weights, we can compute a score uj for each word
in the vocabulary,

From the hidden layer to the output layer, there is a diﬀerent weight matrix W(cid:48) = {w(cid:48)

wj is the j-th column of the matrix W(cid:48). Then we can use softmax, a log-linear

Note that vw and v(cid:48)

w are two representations of the word w. vw comes from rows of
W, which is the input→hidden weight matrix, and v(cid:48)
w comes from columns of W(cid:48), which
is the hidden→output matrix. In subsequent analysis, we call vw as the “input vector”,
and v(cid:48)

w as the “output vector” of the word w.

Update equation for hidden→output weights

Let us now derive the weight update equation for this model. Although the actual com-
putation is impractical (explained below), we are doing the derivation to gain insights on
this original model with no tricks applied. For a review of basics of backpropagation, see
Appendix A.

The training objective (for one training sample) is to maximize (4), the conditional
probability of observing the actual output word wO (denote its index in the output layer
as j∗) given the input context word wI with regard to the weights.

max p(wO|wI ) = max yj∗

where E = − log p(wO|wI ) is our loss function (we want to minimize E), and j∗ is the
index of the actual output word in the output layer. Note that this loss function can be
understood as a special case of the cross-entropy measurement between two probabilistic
distributions.

Let us now derive the update equation of the weights between hidden and output layers.

Take the derivative of E with regard to j-th unit’s net input uj, we obtain

= yj − tj := ej

∂E
∂uj

(8)

where tj = 1(j = j∗), i.e., tj will only be 1 when the j-th unit is the actual output word,
otherwise tj = 0. Note that this derivative is simply the prediction error ej of the output
layer.

wj

(11)
where η > 0 is the learning rate, ej = yj − tj, and hi is the i-th unit in the hidden layer;
v(cid:48)
wj is the output vector of wj. Note that this update equation implies that we have to
go through every possible word in the vocabulary, check its output probability yj, and
compare yj with its expected output tj (either 0 or 1).
If yj > tj (“overestimating”),
then we subtract a proportion of the hidden vector h (i.e., vwI ) from v(cid:48)
wj , thus making
v(cid:48)
wj farther away from vwI ; if yj < tj (“underestimating”, which is true only if tj = 1,
i.e., wj = wO), we add some h to v(cid:48)
If yj is very
close to tj, then according to the update equation, very little change will be made to the
weights. Note, again, that vw (input vector) and v(cid:48)
w (output vector) are two diﬀerent
vector representations of the word w.

, thus making v(cid:48)

closer3 to vwI .

Update equation for input→hidden weights
Having obtained the update equations for W(cid:48), we can now move on to W. We take the
derivative of E on the output of the hidden layer, obtaining

where hi is the output of the i-th unit of the hidden layer; uj is deﬁned in (2), the net
input of the j-th unit in the output layer; and ej = yj − tj is the prediction error of the
j-th word in the output layer. EH, an N -dim vector, is the sum of the output vectors of
all words in the vocabulary, weighted by their prediction error.

Next we should take the derivative of E on W. First, recall that the hidden layer
performs a linear computation on the values from the input layer. Expanding the vector
notation in (1) we get

V(cid:88)

hi =

xk · wki

Now we can take the derivative of E with regard to each element of W, obtaining

(14)

This is equivalent to the tensor product of x and EH, i.e.,

= x ⊗ EH = xEHT

∂E
∂W

(15)
from which we obtain a V × N matrix. Since only one component of x is non-zero, only
∂W is non-zero, and the value of that row is EHT , an N -dim vector. We obtain
one row of ∂E
the update equation of W as

v(new)

wI

= v(old)

wI

− ηEHT

(16)

where vwI is a row of W, the “input vector” of the only context word, and is the only row
of W whose derivative is non-zero. All the other rows of W will remain unchanged after
this iteration, because their derivatives are zero.
Intuitively, since vector EH is the sum of output vectors of all words in vocabulary
weighted by their prediction error ej = yj − tj, we can understand (16) as adding a portion
of every output vector in vocabulary to the input vector of the context word. If, in the
output layer, the probability of a word wj being the output word is overestimated (yj > tj),
then the input vector of the context word wI will tend to move farther away from the output
vector of wj; conversely if the probability of wj being the output word is underestimated
(yj < tj), then the input vector wI will tend to move closer to the output vector of wj;
if the probability of wj is fairly accurately predicted, then it will have little eﬀect on the
movement of the input vector of wI . The movement of the input vector of wI is determined
by the prediction error of all vectors in the vocabulary; the larger the prediction error, the
more signiﬁcant eﬀects a word will exert on the movement on the input vector of the
context word.

As we iteratively update the model parameters by going through context-target word
pairs generated from a training corpus, the eﬀects on the vectors will accumulate. We
can imagine that the output vector of a word w is “dragged” back-and-forth by the input
vectors of w’s co-occurring neighbors, as if there are physical strings between the vector
of w and the vectors of its neighbors. Similarly, an input vector can also be considered as
being dragged by many output vectors. This interpretation can remind us of gravity, or
force-directed graph layout. The equilibrium length of each imaginary string is related to
the strength of cooccurrence between the associated pair of words, as well as the learning
rate. After many iterations, the relative positions of the input and output vectors will
eventually stabilize.

1.2 Multi-word context

Figure 2 shows the CBOW model with a multi-word context setting. When computing
the hidden layer output, instead of directly copying the input vector of the input context
word, the CBOW model takes the average of the vectors of the input context words, and

5

use the product of the input→hidden weight matrix and the average vector as the output.

rate; and EH = ∂E
is given by (12). The intuitive understanding of this update equation
∂hi
is the same as that for (16).

2 Skip-Gram Model

The skip-gram model is introduced in Mikolov et al. (2013a,b). Figure 3 shows the skip-
gram model. It is the opposite of the CBOW model. The target word is now at the input
layer, and the context words are on the output layer.

We still use vwI to denote the input vector of the only word on the input layer, and
thus we have the same deﬁnition of the hidden-layer outputs h as in (1), which means h is
simply copying (and transposing) a row of the input→hidden weight matrix, W, associated
with the input word wI . We copy the deﬁnition of h below:

h = WT

(k,·) := vT
wI

,

(24)

On the output layer, instead of outputing one multinomial distribution, we are output-
ing C multinomial distributions. Each output is computed using the same hidden→output
matrix:

p(wc,j = wO,c|wI ) = yc,j =

(25)

(cid:80)V

exp(uc,j)
j(cid:48)=1 exp(uj(cid:48))

where wc,j is the j-th word on the c-th panel of the output layer; wO,c is the actual c-th
word in the output context words; wI is the only input word; yc,j is the output of the j-th
unit on the c-th panel of the output layer; uc,j is the net input of the j-th unit on the c-th
panel of the output layer. Because the output layer panels share the same weights, thus

uc,j = uj = v(cid:48)

The intuitive understanding of this update equation is the same as that for (11), except
that the prediction error is summed across all context words in the output layer. Note that
we need to apply this update equation for every element of the hidden→output matrix for
each training instance.
The derivation of the update equation for the input→hidden matrix is identical to (12)
to (16), except taking into account that the prediction error ej is replaced with EIj. We
directly give the update equation:

3 Optimizing Computational Eﬃciency

So far the models we have discussed (“bigram” model, CBOW and skip-gram) are both in
their original forms, without any eﬃciency optimization tricks being applied.
For all these models, there exist two vector representations for each word in the vo-
cabulary: the input vector vw, and the output vector v(cid:48)
w. Learning the input vectors is
cheap; but learning the output vectors is very expensive. From the update equations (22)
and (33), we can ﬁnd that, in order to update v(cid:48)
w, for each training instance, we have to
iterate through every word wj in the vocabulary, compute their net input uj, probability

9

prediction yj (or yc,j for skip-gram), their prediction error ej (or EIj for skip-gram), and
ﬁnally use their prediction error to update their output vector v(cid:48)
j.

Doing such computations for all words for every training instance is very expensive,
making it impractical to scale up to large vocabularies or large training corpora. To solve
this problem, an intuition is to limit the number of output vectors that must be updated per
training instance. One elegant approach to achieving this is hierarchical softmax; another
approach is through sampling, which will be discussed in the next section.

Both tricks optimize only the computation of the updates for output vectors. In our
, the

derivations, we care about three values: (1) E, the new objective function; (2) ∂E
∂v(cid:48)
new update equation for the output vectors; and (3) ∂E
errors to be backpropagated for updating input vectors.

3.1 Hierarchical Softmax

Hierarchical softmax is an eﬃcient way of computing softmax (Morin and Bengio, 2005;
Mnih and Hinton, 2009). The model uses a binary tree to represent all words in the
vocabulary. The V words must be leaf units of the tree. It can be proved that there are
V − 1 inner units. For each leaf unit, there exists a unique path from the root to the unit;
and this path is used to estimate the probability of the word represented by the leaf unit.
See Figure 4 for an example tree.

Figure 4: An example binary tree for the hierarchical softmax model. The white units are
words in the vocabulary, and the dark units are inner units. An example path from root to
w2 is highlighted. In the example shown, the length of the path L(w2) = 4. n(w, j) means
the j-th unit on the path from root to the word w.

In the hierarchical softmax model, there is no output vector representation for words.

Instead, each of the V − 1 inner units has an output vector v(cid:48)

Let us intuitively understand the equation by going through an example. Looking at
Figure 4, suppose we want to compute the probability that w2 being the output word. We
deﬁne this probability as the probability of a random walk starting from the root ending
at the leaf unit in question. At each inner unit (including the root unit), we need to assign
the probabilities of going left and going right.4 We deﬁne the probability of going left at
an inner unit n to be

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

p(n, left) = σ

v(cid:48)

T · h

which is determined by both the vector representation of the inner unit, and the hidden
layer’s output value (which is then determined by the vector representation of the input
word(s)). Apparently the probability of going right at unit n is

making the hierarchical softmax a well deﬁned multinomial distribution among all words.
Now let us derive the parameter update equation for the vector representations of the
inner units. For simplicity, we look at the one-word context model ﬁrst. Extending the
update equations to CBOW and skip-gram models is easy.

For the simplicity of notation, we deﬁne the following shortenizations without intro-

ducing ambiguity:

(cid:74)·(cid:75) :=(cid:74)n(w, j + 1) = ch(n(w, j))(cid:75)

4While an inner unit of a binary tree may not always have both children, a binary Huﬀman tree’s inner
units always do. Although theoretically one can use many diﬀerent types of trees for hierarchical softmax,
word2vec uses a binary Huﬀman tree for fast training.

the prediction error for the inner unit n(w, j). The “task” for each inner unit is to predict
whether it should follow the left child or the right child in the random walk. tj = 1 means
the ground truth is to follow the left child; tj = 0 means it should follow the right child.
σ(v(cid:48)
T h) is the prediction result. For a training instance, if the prediction of the inner unit
is very close to the ground truth, then its vector representation v(cid:48)
j will move very little;
otherwise v(cid:48)
j will move in an appropriate direction by moving (either closer or farther away5
from h) so as to reduce the prediction error for this instance. This update equation can
be used for both CBOW and the skip-gram model. When used for the skip-gram model,
we need to repeat this update procedure for each of the C words in the output context.

which can be directly substituted into (23) to obtain the update equation for the input
vectors of CBOW. For the skip-gram model, we need to calculate a EH value for each word
in the skip-gram context, and plug the sum of the EH values into (35) to obtain the update
equation for the input vector.

From the update equations, we can see that the computational complexity per training
instance per context word is reduced from O(V ) to O(log(V )), which is a big improvement
in speed. We still have roughly the same number of parameters (V −1 vectors for inner-units
compared to originally V output vectors for words).

3.2 Negative Sampling

The idea of negative sampling is more straightforward than hierarchical softmax: in order
to deal with the diﬃculty of having too many output vectors that need to be updated per
iteration, we only update a sample of them.

Apparently the output word (i.e., the ground truth, or positive sample) should be kept
in our sample and gets updated, and we need to sample a few words as negative samples
(hence “negative sampling”). A probabilistic distribution is needed for the sampling pro-
cess, and it can be arbitrarily chosen. We call this distribution the noise distribution, and
denote it as Pn(w). One can determine a good distribution empirically.6

In word2vec, instead of using a form of negative sampling that produces a well-deﬁned
posterior multinomial distribution, the authors argue that the following simpliﬁed training
objective is capable of producing high-quality word embeddings:7

E = − log σ(v(cid:48)

wO

log σ(−v(cid:48)

wj

T h)

(55)

where wO is the output word (i.e., the positive sample), and v(cid:48)
the output value of the hidden layer: h = 1
C

is its output vector; h is
c=1 vwc in the CBOW model and h = vwI

wO

6As described in (Mikolov et al., 2013b), word2vec uses a unigram distribution raised to the 3

4 th power

for the best quality of results.

7Goldberg and Levy (2014) provide a theoretical analysis on the reason of using this objective function.

in the skip-gram model; Wneg = {wj|j = 1,··· , K} is the set of words that are sampled
based on Pn(w), i.e., negative samples.

To obtain the update equations of the word vectors under negative sampling, we ﬁrst

take the derivative of E with regard to the net input of the output unit wj:

where tj is the “label” of word wj. t = 1 when wj is a positive sample; t = 0 otherwise.
Next we take the derivative of E with regard to the output vector of the word wj,

∂E

which results in the following update equation for its output vector:

v(cid:48)

(new) = v(cid:48)

(old) − η

σ(v(cid:48)

T h) − tj

(59)
which only needs to be applied to wj ∈ {wO}∪Wneg instead of every word in the vocabulary.
This shows why we may save a signiﬁcant amount of computational eﬀort per iteration.

The intuitive understanding of the above update equation should be the same as that
of (11). This equation can be used for both CBOW and the skip-gram model. For the
skip-gram model, we apply this equation for one context word at a time.

To backpropagate the error to the hidden layer and thus update the input vectors
of words, we need to take the derivative of E with regard to the hidden layer’s output,
obtaining

By plugging EH into (23) we obtain the update equation for the input vectors of the
CBOW model. For the skip-gram model, we need to calculate a EH value for each word in
the skip-gram context, and plug the sum of the EH values into (35) to obtain the update
equation for the input vector.

A Back Propagation Basics

A.1 Learning Algorithms for a Single Unit
Figure 5 shows an artiﬁcial neuron (unit). {x1,··· , xK} are input values; {w1,··· , wK} are
weights; y is a scalar output; and f is the link function (also called activation/decision/transfer
function).

Figure 5: An artiﬁcial neuron

The unit works in the following way:

y = f (u),

(62)

where u is a scalar number, which is the net input (or “new input”) of the neuron. u is
deﬁned as

K(cid:88)

u =

wixi.

(63)

(64)

Using vector notation, we can write

i=0

u = wT x

Note that here we ignore the bias term in u. To include a bias term, one can simply

add an input dimension (e.g., x0) that is constant 1.

Apparently, diﬀerent link functions result in distinct behaviors of the neuron. We

discuss two example choices of link functions here.

The ﬁrst example choice of f (u) is the unit step function (aka Heaviside step

function):

f (u) =

(cid:40)

1
0

if u > 0
otherwise

(65)

A neuron with this link function is called a perceptron. The learning algorithm for a

perceptron is the perceptron algorithm. Its update equation is deﬁned as:

w(new) = w(old) − η · (y − t) · x

(66)

16

x1x2x3xKfyw1w2w3wKwhere t is the label (gold standard) and η is the learning rate (η > 0). Note that a
perceptron is a linear classiﬁer, which means its description capacity can be very limited.
If we want to ﬁt more complex functions, we need to use a non-linear model.

The second example choice of f (u) is the logistic function (a most common kind of

sigmoid function), deﬁned as

σ(u) =

1

1 + e−u

(67)

The logistic function has two primary good properties: (1) the output y is always between
0 and 1, and (2) unlike a unit step function, σ(u) is smooth and diﬀerentiable, making the
derivation of update equation very easy.

Note that σ(u) also has the following two properties that can be very convenient and

will be used in our subsequent derivations:

σ(−u) = 1 − σ(u)

dσ(u)

du

= σ(u)σ(−u)

(68)

(69)

We use stochastic gradient descent as the learning algorithm of this model. In order to
derive the update equation, we need to deﬁne the error function, i.e., the training objective.
The following objective function seems to be convenient:

E =

(t − y)2

We take the derivative of E with regard to wi,

(70)

(72)

∂u = y(1 − y) because y = f (u) = σ(u), and (68) and (69). Once we have the

where ∂y
derivative, we can apply stochastic gradient descent:

w(new) = w(old) − η · (y − t) · y(1 − y) · x.

(73)

A.2 Back-propagation with Multi-Layer Network
Figure 6 shows a multi-layer neural network with an input layer {xk} = {x1,··· , xK}, a
hidden layer {hi} = {h1,··· , hN}, and an output layer {yj} = {y1,··· , yM}. For clarity
we use k, i, j as the subscript for input, hidden, and output layer units respectively. We use
ui and u(cid:48)
j to denote the net input of hidden layer units and output layer units respectively.
We want to derive the update equation for learning the weights wki between the input
and hidden layers, and w(cid:48)
ij between the hidden and output layers. We assume that all the

Figure 6: A multi-layer neural network with one hidden layer

computation units (i.e., units in the hidden layer and the output layer) use the logistic
function σ(u) as the link function. Therefore, for a unit hi in the hidden layer, its output
is deﬁned as

Similarly, for a unit yj in the output layer, its output is deﬁned as

We use the squared sum error function given by

E(x, t, W, W(cid:48)) =

1
2

(yj − tj)2,

where W = {wki}, a K × N weight matrix (input-hidden), and W(cid:48) = {w(cid:48)
ij}, a N × M
weight matrix (hidden-output). t = {t1,··· , tM}, a M -dimension vector, which is the
gold-standard labels of output.

To obtain the update equations for wki and w(cid:48)

ij, we simply need to take the derivative
of the error function E with regard to the weights respectively. To make the derivation
straightforward, we do start computing the derivative for the right-most layer (i.e., the
output layer), and then move left. For each layer, we split the computation into three
steps, computing the derivative of the error with regard to the output, net input, and
weight respectively. This process is shown below.

18

y1y2y3yMh1h2hNx1x2x3xKInput layerHidden layerOutput layer{wki}{w'ij}We start with the output layer. The ﬁrst step is to compute the derivative of the error

w.r.t. the output:

= yj − tj.

∂E
∂yj

(77)

The second step is to compute the derivative of the error with regard to the net input of
the output layer. Note that when taking derivatives with regard to something, we need to
keep everything else ﬁxed. Also note that this value is very important because it will be
reused multiple times in subsequent computations. We denote it as EI(cid:48)

j for simplicity.

(78)

The third step is to compute the derivative of the error with regard to the weight between
the hidden layer and the output layer.

where η > 0 is the learning rate.

We can repeat the same three steps to obtain the update equation for weights of the

previous layer, which is essentially the idea of back propagation.

We repeat the ﬁrst step and compute the derivative of the error with regard to the
output of the hidden layer. Note that the output of the hidden layer is related to all units
in the output layer.

(82)

Then we repeat the second step above to compute the derivative of the error with regard
to the net input of the hidden layer. This value is again very important, and we denote it
as EIi.

the weights between the input layer and the hidden layer.

Finally, we can obtain the update equation for weights between the input layer and the
hidden layer.

(new) = wki

(old) − η · EIi · xk.

(85)

From the above example, we can see that the intermediate results (EI(cid:48)

j) when computing
the derivatives for one layer can be reused for the previous layer. Imagine there were another
layer prior to the input layer, then EIi can also be reused to continue computing the chain
of derivatives eﬃciently. Compare Equations (78) and (83), we may ﬁnd that in (83), the
ij is just like the “error” of the hidden layer unit hi. We may interpret
this term as the error “back-propagated” from the next layer, and this propagation may
go back further if the network has more hidden layers.

B wevi: Word Embedding Visual Inspector

An interactive visual interface, wevi (word embedding visual inspector), is available online
to demonstrate the working mechanism of the models described in this paper. See Figure 7
for a screenshot of wevi.

The demo allows the user to visually examine the movement of input vectors and output
vectors as each training instance is consumed. The training process can be also run in batch
mode (e.g., consuming 500 training instances in a row), which can reveal the emergence of
patterns in the weight matrices and the corresponding word vectors. Principal component
analysis (PCA) is employed to visualize the “high”-dimensional vectors in a 2D scatter
plot. The demo supports both CBOW and skip-gram models.

After training the model, the user can manually activate one or multiple input-layer
units, and inspect which hidden-layer units and output-layer units become active. The
user can also customize training data, hidden layer size, and learning rate. Several preset
training datasets are provided, which can generate diﬀerent results that seem interesting,
such as using a toy vocabulary to reproduce the famous word analogy: king - queen = man
- woman.

It is hoped that by interacting with this demo one can quickly gain insights of the
working mechanism of the model. The system is available at http://bit.ly/wevi-online.
